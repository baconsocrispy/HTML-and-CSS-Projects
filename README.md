# HTML-and-CSS-Projects

## Introduction

The files in this repository are HTML and CSS projects I completed as part of the 'HTML and CSS Course' through The Tech Academy Software Developer Bootcamp in May, 2022. The course introduced students to the fundamentals of both languages as well as the Bootstrap framework.

## Projects

* Plant Website
* Cinemas Website

### Plant Website

As part of this course we created a couple of one-page websites to practice our HTML and CSS skills. I created a simple three section site about edible wild plants that made use of navigation, photo gallery and form submission elements.

### Cinemas Website

For the second site, I created a website about a fictional cinema. The site made use of the Bootstrap framework, while providing more HTML and CSS practice with navigation, forms, and layout fundamentals.
