		<h3>About the Author</h3>
		<img src="myron_chase.jpg" width="350">
		<blockquote>Myron Chase had a life-long interest and concern for plantlife, waging an admirable, but failed campaign against big logging in the early 20th Century. In front of the tallest tree known at the time, the '<a href="https://render.fineartamerica.com/images/rendered/medium/print/7.5/8/break/images/artworkimages/medium/2/mount-washington-print-collector.jpg">Behmouth Pine</a>', a monster nestled in New Hampshire's White Mountain Range, Myron famously declared, "When I'm done, the axe of the lumberman shall never ring again, and America's bird life, wildflowers and animals shall be protected in perpetuity." He died shortly thereafter in 1931 from complications of severe poverty. This field guide was first published posthumously in 1932, distilled from extensive notes he scrawled in his journal as he wandered the forests of New England from 1929-1931. Though it did not sell many copies on first release, it is re-published here.</blockquote>
		<h3>Dedication</h3>
		<blockquote>No creatur brought more joy to a poor man's life than my beloved Tinkerbell did me. She barked at no man's bid but mine own. Our time together on this earthly paradise twas too shortly spent. She saved my life at Arethusa Falls. A couragiss and good natur'd mutt. This tome is dedicated to such a fine beest.</blockquote> 
		<p>[Ed. An old photograph of Tinkerbell was found among Myron's belongings. She is seen here in a portrait typical of the time period (1920s America): <a href="Dog.html">Tinkerbell</a>. Learn more about '<a href="Dog_Video.html">Hero Dogs</a>'.]</p>
